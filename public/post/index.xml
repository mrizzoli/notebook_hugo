      <description>Reference: article from [@hann_civil_1996]
Jenny B. White&amp;rsquo;s argument is that civic cultures exist in Turkey on a community level that precedes and upon which social movements build their networks.
She also compare these &amp;ldquo;informal&amp;rdquo; community ties and political space to the more regulated organizations, arguing that the former are usually left behind in academic literature and therefore seriously understudied and under-represented.
Two main problematic points come out by overcoming this misrepresentation, firstly we can see that civil society might be possible in Islamic countries and, as a cosequence for this, that a democratizing discourse is possible in Islam based cultures.</description>
