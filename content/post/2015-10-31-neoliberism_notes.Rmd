### theoretical approach as a consequence of amartya sen's paradox as we can see in the definition/analysis of neoliberism proposed by wacquant and in the proposed applications of neoliberist methods and techniques to social welfare purposes by ferguson:

>The liberal paradox is a logical paradox advanced by Amartya Sen, building on the work of Kenneth Arrow and his impossibility theorem, which showed that within a system of menu-independent social choice, it is impossible to have both a commitment to "Minimal Liberty", which was defined as the ability to order tuples of choices, and Pareto optimality.

The most contentious aspect is, on one hand, to contradict the libertarian notion that the market mechanism is sufficient to produce a Pareto-optimal society—and on the other hand, argue that degrees of choice and freedom, rather than welfare economics, should be the defining trait of that market mechanism. As a result it attracts commentary from both the left and the right of the political spectrum.

>ABOUT PARETO'S EFFICIENCY: In a Pareto efficient economic allocation, no one can be made better off without making at least one individual worse off. Given an initial allocation of goods among a set of individuals, a change to a different allocation that makes at least one individual better off without making any other individual worse off is called a Pareto improvement. An allocation is defined as "Pareto efficient" or "Pareto optimal" when no further Pareto improvements can be made.

Pareto efficiency is a minimal notion of efficiency and does not necessarily result in a socially desirable distribution of resources: it makes no statement about equality, or the overall well-being of a society. The notion of Pareto efficiency can also be applied to the selection of alternatives in engineering and similar fields. Each option is first assessed under multiple criteria and then a subset of options is identified with the property that no other option can categorically outperform any of its members.


### Wacquant

startin point: ethnogpraphy in the chicago ghettos that conducted the author to analyze the increasing oppressive policies in what he calls “the america's gargantuan carceral system”

so the purpose of the paper is to link the micro (????) ethnography of the “postindustrial precariat” to the macro sociology of the neoliberal leviathan:

from here he analyzes the realization of neoliberist programs and their reflection in society.

identifies three common traits in the application of these policies as summarized in the end of the paper

from a theoretical point of view he sees the:
neoliberalism as an articulation of state, market and citizenship that harnesses the first to impose the stamp of the second onto the third

also useful in defining is the concept of:
governmentality (foucault)
but
devoid of specifity in its definition ofgoverning through calculation, so it can be applied almost everywhere but doesn't really add further undertsnding in trying to define neoliberalsm

as an example he draws from the conclusions of his ethnographic research that starting from the 70ies there is an active tendency of the us government to racialise poverty and to apply increasingly repressive measures to deal with the reactions against the consequences of market deregulation and withdrawal of social welfare system

confirmation of this theory is seen in the battle against street crime pusrued almost by every left government in europe after 1990	
in author's words:in sum, the penalisation of poverty emerged as a core element of the domestic implementation and transborder diffusion of the neoliberal project, the ‘iron fist’ of the penal state mating with the ‘invisible hand’ of the market in conjunction with the fraying of the social safety net

2 main views about understanding neoliberism :
1) self regulationg market – state's withdrawal as a role just to allow building a framework into which an autonomous development of economic practices based on free market can be realized

2)governmentality- active presence of the state in realizing through practices whose purpose is to shape people (subjects-citizens) and societal relations a new “commodization of everything”- based economy

since the second agrues mainly about practices through realizing neoliberism also recognizes that it's not a monolithic concept but actually is extremely dependent on the context :
there is not one big-n neoliberalism but an indefinite number of small-n neoliberalisms born of the ongoing hybridisation of neoliberal practices and ideas with local conditions and forms.

since everything can be recognized as a local variation in an increasing particularism that can't allow any kind of general abstraction into theory

=>requires a generalized normativity

the author poses himself in a via media [proposed is] in the sense that it defiles from pure governmentality or market center conceptions from the fact that recognize a preminence in state actions to achieve economic ends in redrawing its inner societal boundaries and relations accordingly to market conforming policies

=>from a ‘thin’ economic conception centred on the market to a ‘thick’ sociological conception centred on the state that specifies the institutional machinery involved in the establishment of market dominance and its operant impact on effective social membership.

main goal : is to find common practices in the attempt to obtain a neater definition of neoliberalism,
three main thesis are discussed:
(1) neoliberalism is not an economic regime but a political project of state-crafting that puts disciplinary ‘workfare’, neutralising ‘prisonfare’ and the trope of individual responsibility at the service of commodification;

market is part of the political arena:
mauss, polanyi ecc. demonstrated social and economic relations are strictly intertwined, as a consequence there are social reactions to attempts of commodization and the state must overcome this opposition.
thus neoliberism poses itself in the middle between socialist and keynesian collective solutions and the pure liberist self-regulationg market

4 main points to realize that: commodization, disciplinary social policy (social assistance is made conditional upon submission to flexible employment), expansive and pornographic (????????) penalty , the use of individual responsibility

(2) neoliberalism entails a rightward tilting of the space of bureaucratic agencies that define and distribute public goods and spawns a centaur-state that practises liberalism at the top of the class structure and punitive paternalism at the bottom;
using bourdieu terms, the boureaucratic space is where the state makes the shift to the marketization/commodization of its own systems- punishing the poor  by moving resources to the social to the penal wing and by including neoliberist techniques in the management of welfare, health care education ecc. (shift from left hand feminine policies to right hand and masculine-- coercitive)

(3) the growth and glorification of the penal wing of the state is an integral component of the
neoliberal leviathan, such that the police, courts and prison need to be brought into the political anthropology of neoliberal rule.

as a consequence of point 2 an increasing repressive policy and overall amount of inmates has surged along the establishment of market economy, especially against the “weak” segments of society that were the most affected by the changes in welfare system and labor market pusrued by the state.
examples:
- aggressive deployment of the police
- increased recourse to the courts to handle unruly behavior and minor offenses mushrooming of administrative retention centres to corral and expel irregular migrants	boom of a media sector trading on catastrophic images of criminal danger
	
    upon examining trends in a dozen advanced societies distributed among four types of political economy, cavadino and dignan report ‘a general tendency for changes in these countries’ punishment levels over time [fitting] the same pattern: ‘as a society moves in the direction of neo-liberalism, its punishment becomes harsher’ examples: us after 1970 chile and latin america in the early 80ies 	and england during 90's
    1)control and suppress potential insurgents and destabylizing factors
    2)reestablish trhough coercion the legitimacy of political 	leadership against the increasing role played by the market

as a conclusion we can see how this resemble more as an ongoing  process of state formation/building than a pure shift in political-economy and thus should be analysed accordingly to this view, the different elements and outcomes as part of a process that has also to adapt to local peculiarities.
in the author's interpretation so we can outline that the three points extrapolated can be a common trait in the transformations that are involved in this process

historical anthropology of neoliberalism as it actually evolves we must acknowledge that it pertains to the register of state formation. much like the ‘long sixteenth century’ saw the birth of the modern leviathan in western europe

### James Ferguson
for over the last couple of decades, what we call “the left” has come to be  organized, in large part, around a project of resisting and refusing harmful new developments in the world.
leftist policies defined as anti instead of pro as if the only space left is the opposition to neoliberist policies; studies of state and development tend, with depressing predictability, to conclude (in tones of righteous indignation) that the rich are benefiting and the poor are getting screwed. any realistic sort of progressive  politics that would seek a serious answer to the question “what do we want?” will have to involve an exploration of the contemporary possibilities for developing genuinely progressive arts of government.


lack of an ensemble of ideas to characterize an active leftist policy :1979 foucault lecture: “absence of a socialist artof government” the challenge is how to implement socialist ideas in a market economy
since there's no possibility to “go back” and recreate the socio-political setting that was in exestence before '70ies, left politicians and ideologists have to find a way to include poverty question and social welfare into the contemporary context of neoliberism and free market	

1)shift from the keynesian welfare system as a pact between “workers” and individuals that required social intervention (elderly, infirm ecc) due to the increasing amount of unemployed and informal workers that are in the same needs even if they should be part of the labor force

2)increasing separation between state and social policy delegating the latter to ngo's and international organizations

can we imagine new “arts of government” that might take advantage of (rather than simply denouncing or resisting) recent transformations in the spatial organization of government and social assistance?

we need to develop new ways of thinking that don't take for granted previously fundamental categories like “the worker” or “the nation-state” since their no more effective

=>in which ways we can use neoliberism to apply progressive policies

there is a clear analysis in this literature of what it is that distinguishes “neoliberalism” from liberalism. liberalism, in this account, was always about finding the right balance between
two spheres understood as properly distinct, if always related: state and market, public and private, the realm of the king and the proper domain of the merchant. neoliberalism, in contrast, puts governmental mechanisms developed in the private sphere to work within the state itself, so that even core functions of the state are either subcontracted out to private providers, or run  “like a business”. the question of what should be public and what private becomes blurred, as the state itself increasingly organizes itself around “profit centers”, “enterprise models”, and so on.

neoliberism as a confusing term:

we may consider the new governmental rationalities that emerged through the thatcher–reagan assaults on the north atlantic, post-war welfare state. key here was the deployment of market mechanisms and “enterprise” models to reform government, construction of active and rational citizens able to act in the new shape of the society	

thus said if we look at the application of neoliberism in africa, we can see that it has really few of neo: its mostly similar just to liberist deregulation of market to allow the intrusion of foreign capitals

from a certain point of view the author seems to define the term neoliberism as a neutral and descriptive concept more related to methodologies of “governmentality” than to a politic vies strictly speaking, thus he argues that these same methods can be diverted and used for social purposes

one possible way to exploit market economy for progressist purposes is the south african basic income grant the argument goes like this:

- markets aren’t working for poor people because they’re too poor to participate in them;
- government programs aren’t working because the state is inefficient.

so, provide income support directly, in the form of cash, and then say to the poor: “you are now empowered to solve your own problems in the way you see best”

the reasoning here often includes recognizably neoliberal elements, including the valorization of market efficiency, individual choice, and autonomy; themes of entrepreneurship; and skepticism about the state as a service provider but the purpose is a pro poor policy

the idea of a big was first put forward by the labor union federation, cosatu, in 1998, and it acquired new legitimacy when it was embraced in 2002 by a government-appointed committee (the taylor committee) charged with recommending measures for the rationalization of the system of social assistance

the big campaign is significant not only as an interesting and potentially progressive policy proposal, but also as an illustration of some new ways of thinking about questions of poverty and welfare that bring neoliberal themes to bear on the question of social assistance

a big, supporters say, would enable poor south africans to increase their spending on such things as nutrition, education, and health care. and this, advocates insist, should be understood as an “investment” in a kind of “capital”. such “investment”, they insist, will bring handsome returns, in the form of productivity gains. the poor individual is in this way conceived, in classic neoliberal fashion, as a kind of micro-enterprise, earning a rate of return on invested capital.
combating dependency the existing “safety net”, the big promoters argue, relies on very destructive forms of dependency since any economically productive poor person is surrounded by relatives and other dependents who must be supported.

providing basic income security for all, it is claimed, will enable the poor to behave as proper neoliberal subjects (ie as entrepreneurs and risk takers); the status quo prevents it, and promotes “dependency”.

they would not need the government to tell them how to spend the funds. they would use them (like good rational actors) in the way they saw best. there would be no “nanny state”: no policing of conduct, no stigmatizing labels, no social workers coming into homes and no costly bureaucracy to sort out who does or doesn’t qualify.

social payments, in this optic, are most significant not as temporary substitutes for employment, but as a way of promoting greater productivity, enterprise, and risk-taking in the “informal” domain within which more and more south africans are expected to make their living.

food aid and cash transfers

the example i have in mind is the increasingly influential argument that hunger is best dealt with by boosting the purchasing power of those at risk, rather than by distributing in-kind food aid.

actual system of food aid relies mainly on surplus production in rich countries and its redistribution to people in risk of hunger

negative impacts of such policies, which tend to depress producer prices for local farmers,while damaging local institutions for producing and distributing food crops. once food aid has arrived, local food production may never recover.

as an alternative,amartya sen’s followers have pushed for cash payments to be made directly to those at risk of food deficit: people with money in their pockets, these advocates point out, usually don’t starve
dispensing cash, they insist, is in the first place more efficient and less expensive than other sorts of assistance,and often requires less infrastructure and institutional capacity. in any case, they argue, why should bureaucrats decide on behalf of recipients what their needs are?
 and poor people, in this conception, are good judges of how to do that—using money to go to the clinic this month, to pay school fees for a child the next, to buy a bag of maize meal the next, and so on. rather than wasting the money on frivolous expenditure, advocates insist, recipients generally apply their scant cash resources very rationally, and even make canny small investments.
top-down, state-planned attempts to directly meet nutritional needs through trucking in food, in this view, are bound to be clumsy, inefficient, and wasteful

consider, guyer suggests, how food ends up finding its way to consumers’ plates in the vast megacities of west africa such as lagos. the logistical task of moving thousands of tons of food each day from thousands of local producers to millions of urban consumers would be beyond the organizational capacity of any state
such forms of organization must appear especially attractive where states lack capacity (and let
us remember how many progressive dreams in africa have crashed on the rocks of low state capacity).

market-based solutions are thus likely to be true “solutions” only for the better- off, whose needs are so effectively catered to by markets. but the food aid example shows a way of redirecting markets toward the poor, by intervening not to restrict the market, but to boost purchasing power.

steven collier (2005) has recently pointed out, it is important to question the assumption that there is, or must be, a neat or automatic fit between a hegemonic “neoliberal” political-economic project (however that might be characterized), on the one hand, and specific “neoliberal” techniques, on the other
social technologies need not have any essential or eternal loyalty to the political formations within which they were first developed

the answers to the left’s governmental problems require not yet another search through our sacred texts, but a process of conceptual and institutional innovation.
“[i]f there is a really socialist governmentality, then it is not hidden within socialism and its texts. it
cannot be deduced from them. it must be invented”.
but invention in the domain of governmental technique is rarely something worked up out of whole cloth. more often, it involves a kind of bricolage
begin making an inventory of the parts available and what kind of purpose they may serve
go beyond seeing neoliberism as evil
learn to use governmental technique for new social purposes
