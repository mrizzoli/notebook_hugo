<p>Reference: <span class="citation">(Warren <a href="#ref-warren_democracy_1999">1999</a>)</span>: Democracy and social capital by Eric M. Uslaner</p>
<p>The concept of trust is central in a prosperous Democracy as it is a preminent part of what Putnam defined as social capital, and in Uslaner’s conceptualization is important as it sets moral values that are precurors of civic networks and social connectedness. Trust leads to cooperation by pushing people to behave morally and develop feelings of reciprocity to each other.
The author makes a distinction between generalized and particularized trust, we can see several similarities with the concep of Solidarity vs solidarity as described by Bugra since he opposes trust only related to ones of your own kind vs trust towards a more generalized spectrum of people (the author is a bit vague in this distinction)</p>
<p>Trust is then defined as a rational gamble, betting that on the long run there will be more benefits than relying only on one’s own self or on a kin-based small group of people.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We need to go beyond our kin and in-groups to trust a wide range of people, especially those whom we don’t know and who are different from us. Charitable contributions exemplify this dilemma. Voluntary giving heps make a community prosperous by reducing poverty and helping the underprivileged to make a fresh start.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He also repeats the concept of “bad associations” like KKK or similar exclusive groups as being based on a prticularized trust, thus not being included on the definition of social capital which is based and develops when relationships among individuals are based on a generalized trust.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When people trust only their kind, they withdraw from civic life. […] As trust in others falls so does participation in civic activities</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The television thesis proposed by Putnam to explain the ebbing of civic activism depends on the fact that time spent in front of the tv is the single biggest change in american society since the 50ies.. (but it doesn’t say why it is considered a cause and not a consequence) and as the author puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The generations raised on television […] became the new misanthropes. They are less trusting and join fewer voluntary organizations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the Author’s analysis although this thesis seems to be unable to account for the change in civic activism as apparently some time of tv shows actually lead people to be more engaged. He then proposes optimism vs pessimism as a explanatory variable for trust, as there are relatively few distrusting optimists as well as few trusting pessimists (this looks almost a tautology to me as we defined trust as a bet for long run benefits so obviously who ahs faith in the future would think that there are better odds at winning betting on trust than who hasn’t, also definition of being optimist as posed by the author seems to imply some feelings and attitudes that alread encompass the concept of trust as being part of being optimists).</p>
<p>One of the first consequence of optimism being so closely related to trust is that when the future looks bleak (as for example during an economic crisis or when income inequality increases) trust makes less sense for the ones that are worse off in society, increasing greatly the risk in “loosing the long run gamble on trust” (does this leads us to expect waves of trust and solidarity following the example of Kondrateff’s waves?)</p>
<p>About the correlation between democracy and trust the Author argues that there is no proof that trust can build democracy nor that democracy can build trust, while at the same time authoritarian regimes are proven to have to destroy civil society to thrive.</p>
<p>But “<em>To have a democracy does not mean that you have a well functioning government. Societies that are badyl polarised by class or ethnic divisions may have democratic constitutions but they won’t work well as deocracies.</em>” This argument is compelling since we should not just focus on defining democracy purely on a legal and constitutional system but also looking at the quality of the democratic environment. This is because as we are obesrving nowadays there is an apparently strong correlation between the lack of trust in well developed democracies and the rise o populist and sectarian politicians.</p>
