<p>Turkish legal tradition has to be interpreted within the <em>civil law</em> tradition of european tradition. (main difference from the <em>common law</em> used for example in the US is that precedents canâ€™t be accepted as a primary source of law).</p>
<p>thus in Turkey the main body of laws regarding NPOs is mostly found in the body of private law. But since there are disparate categories of entities that can be considered as NPOs in turkish legislation: unions, chambers and professional organizations, associations, foundations and cooperatives the actual regulations are scattered across the private and public branches.</p>
