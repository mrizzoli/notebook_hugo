##Accessibility:
- always use alt="" for impaired vision readers, if the image doesn't need description leave it blank
- use h tags without jumping numbers for subsections (used by reader for semantic summaries): h3 right "under" h2 etc... use css to fix properties for better rendering/reading
- HTML5 introduced a number of new elements that give developers more options while also incorporating accessibility features. These tags include main, header, footer, nav, article, and section, among others. By default these are rendered as the more generic div

ALSO:
<div> - groups content
<section> - groups related content
<article> - groups independent, self-contained content

##Landmark features

### Header tag.
It's used to wrap introductory information or navigation links for its parent tag, and works well around content that's repeated at the top on multiple pages.

###Nav.
Works as a div but it's used for semantic navigation among main links

###footer
